Starts the process specified by argv in the given working directory and
redirects its standard output streams.

This function should be called after process_init. After this function completes
(without error) the child process actually starts running and can be seen in the
Task Manager (Windows) or top (Linux).

\param[in,out] process Cannot be NULL.

\param[in] argv An array of UTF-8 encoded, null terminated strings specifying
the program to execute along with its arguments.

- The first element in the array indicates the program to run. This can be an
absolute path, a path relative to the working_directory (also passed as
argument) or the name of an executable located in the PATH. Cannot be NULL.
- The following elements indicate the whitespace delimited arguments passed to
the executable. None of these elements can be NULL.
- The final element must be NULL.

Example: ["cmake", "-G", "Ninja", "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release", NULL]

\param[in] argc Specifies the amount of elements in argv. Should NOT include the
NULL value at the end of the array.

Example: if argv is ["cmake", "--help", NULL] then argc is 2.

\param[in] working_directory Specified the working directory for the child
process. If working_directory is NULL, the child process runs in the same
directory as the current process.

For pipes, the write system call on both Windows and POSIX platforms will block
until the requested amount of bytes have been written to the pipe so this
function should only rarely succeed without writing the full amount of bytes
requested.

/*!
Reads up to \p to_read bytes from the child process' standard output and
stores them in \p buffer. \p actual is set to the amount of bytes actually read.

Assuming no other errors occur this function keeps returning PROCESS_LIB_SUCCESS
until the child process closes its standard output stream (happens automatically
when it exits) and all bytes have been read from the stream. This allows the
function to be used in the following way to read all data from a child process'
stdout:

\code{.cpp}
std::stringstream ss;

while (true) {
  error = process_read(process, buffer, buffer_size - 1, &actual);
  if (error) { break; }

  buffer[actual] = '\0';

Remember that this function reads bytes and not strings. It is up to the user to
put a null terminator if he wants to use \p buffer as a string after this
function completes.

\param[in,out] process Cannot be NULL.
\param[out] buffer Pointer to memory block where bytes read from stdout should
be stored.
\param[in] to_read Maximum number of bytes to read from stdout.
\param[out] actual Actual amount of bytes read from stdout.
