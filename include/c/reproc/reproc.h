/*!
Starts the process specified by argv in the given working directory and
redirects its standard output streams.

If this function does not return an error the child process actually starts
executing and can be inspected using the operating system's tools for process
inspection (e.g. ps on Linux).

Every successful call to this function should be followed by a call to \see
reproc_wait (and possibly \see reproc_terminate or \see reproc_kill) and \see
reproc_destroy after the process has exited. If an error occurs the function
cleans up all allocated resources are cleaned up before the function returns.

\param[in,out] process Cannot be NULL.

\param[in] argv An array of UTF-8 encoded, null terminated strings specifying
the program to execute along with its arguments. Must at least contain one
element. Cannot be NULL.

- The first element in the array indicates the executable to run. This can be
an absolute path, a path relative to the working directory (also passed as
argument) or the name of an executable located in the PATH. Cannot be NULL.
- The following elements indicate the whitespace delimited arguments passed to
the executable. None of these elements can be NULL.
- The final element must be NULL.

Example: ["cmake", "-G", "Ninja", "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release", NULL]

\param[in] argc Specifies the amount of elements in argv. Should NOT include
the NULL value at the end of the array. Must be bigger than or equal to 1.

Example: if argv is ["cmake", "--help", NULL] then argc is 2.

\param[in] working_directory Indicates the working directory for the child
process. If it is NULL, the child process runs in the same directory as the
current process.

Writes up to \p to_write bytes from \p buffer to the standard input (stdin) of

For pipes, the write system call on both Windows and POSIX platforms will
block until the requested amount of bytes have been written to the pipe so
this function should only rarely succeed without writing the full amount of
bytes requested.

(POSIX) Writing to a closed stdin pipe by default terminates the parent process
with the `SIGPIPE` signal. reproc_write will only return REPROC_STREAM_CLOSED if
this signal is ignored by the parent process.

\param[in] buffer Pointer to memory block from which bytes should be written.

/*!
Reads up to \p size bytes from the child process' standard output and stores
them in \p buffer. \p bytes_read is set to the amount of bytes read.

Assuming no other errors occur this function returns REPROC_SUCCESS until the
child process closes its standard output stream (happens automatically when it
exits) and all bytes have been read from the stream. This allows the function to
be used in the following way to read all data from a child process stdout stream
(uses C++ std::string for brevity):

\code{.cpp}
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

...

char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
std::string output{};

while (true) {
  unsigned int bytes_read = 0;
  error = reproc_read(process, REPROC_STDOUT, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, &bytes_read);
  if (error) { break; }

  output.append(buffer, bytes_read);
}

if (error != REPROC_STREAM_CLOSED) { return error; }

// Do something with output
\endcode

Remember that this function reads bytes and not strings. It is up to the user
to add a null terminator if he wants to use \p buffer as a null terminated
string after this function completes. However, this is easily accomplished as
long as we make sure to leave space for the null terminator in the buffer when
reading:

\code{.c}
unsigned int bytes_read = 0;
error = reproc_read(process, REPROC_STDOUT, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE - 1,
                    &bytes_read); //               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
if (error) { return error; }

buffer[bytes_read] = '\0'; // Add null terminator
\endcode

\param[in,out] process Cannot be NULL.
\param[in] stream Stream to read from. Cannot be REPROC_STDIN.
\param[out] buffer Pointer to buffer where bytes read from stdout should be
stored.
\param[in] size Maximum number of bytes to read from stdout. \param[out]
bytes_read Amount of bytes read from stdout. Set to zero if an error occurs.
Cannot be NULL.

Waits the specified amount of time for the child process to exit. If the child
process exited normally the exit status of the process is stored in \p
exit_status.

Exiting normally is defined as follows for the different platforms:
- POSIX: The process returned from its main function or called exit or _exit
- Windows: The process returned from its main or WinMain function

If the function did not exit normally the following values are stored in \p
exit_status:
- POSIX: Number of the signal that terminated the child process
- Windows: exit status passed to ExitProcess or TerminateProcess function call
that terminated the child process

This function cannot be called again for the current child process if a previous
call to reproc_wait, reproc_terminate or reproc_kill was succesfull.

\param[in,out] process Cannot be NULL.
\param[in] milliseconds Amount of milliseconds to wait. If 0 the function will
only check if the process is still running without waiting. If REPROC_INFINITE
the function will wait indefinitely for the child process to exit.
\param[out] exit_status Optional output parameter used to store the exit status
of the child process if reproc_wait is succesfull (the child process exits
within the timeout).

the child process to exit.

Because child processes can still exit normally when receiving CTRL-BREAK or
SIGTERM this function also takes an optional out argument to store the possible
exit status of the child process.
