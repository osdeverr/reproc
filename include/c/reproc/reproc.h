Starts the process specified by argv in the given working directory and
redirects its standard output streams.

This function should be called after \see reproc_init. If this function
returns without error the child process actually starts running and can be
seen in the Task Manager (Windows) or top (Linux).

Every successful call to this function should be followed by a call to \see
reproc_destroy after the process has exited. If an error occurs the function
cleans up all allocated resources itself so you should call reproc_init again
if you want to retry.

\param[in,out] reproc Cannot be NULL. Must have been initialized with \see
reproc_init.

\param[in] argv An array of UTF-8 encoded, null terminated strings specifying
the program to execute along with its arguments. Must at least contain one
element. Cannot be NULL.

- The first element in the array indicates the executable to run. This can be an
absolute path, a path relative to the working directory (also passed as
argument) or the name of an executable located in the PATH. Cannot be NULL.
- The following elements indicate the whitespace delimited arguments passed to
the executable. None of these elements can be NULL.
- The final element must be NULL.

Example: ["cmake", "-G", "Ninja", "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release", NULL]

\param[in] argc Specifies the amount of elements in argv. Should NOT include the
NULL value at the end of the array. Must be bigger than or equal to 1.

Example: if argv is ["cmake", "--help", NULL] then argc is 2.

\param[in] working_directory Indicates the working directory for the child
process. If it is NULL, the child process runs in the same directory as the
current process.

Reads up to \p size bytes from the child process' standard output and stores
them in \p buffer. \p bytes_read is set to the amount of bytes read.

Assuming no other errors occur this function keeps returning REPROC_SUCCESS
until the child process closes its standard output stream (happens automatically
when it exits) and all bytes have been read from the stream. This allows the
function to be used in the following way to read all data from a child process'
stdout:

\code{.cpp}

  if (error) { break; }

  buffer[bytes_read] = '\0';

put a null terminator if he wants to use \p buffer as a string after this
function completes.

On POSIX, if an error occurs after fork but before exec it is communicated to
the parent process which sets its own errno value to the errno value of the
