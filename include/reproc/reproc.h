Starts the process specified by \p argv in the given working directory and
redirects its standard input and output streams.

If this function does not return an error the child process will have started
running and can be inspected using the operating system's tools for process
inspection (e.g. ps on Linux).

Every successful call to this function should be followed by a successful call
to #reproc_wait or #reproc_stop and a call to #reproc_destroy. If an error
occurs during #reproc_start all allocated resources are cleaned up before
#reproc_start returns and no further action is required.

\param[in,out] process Cannot be `NULL`.
\param[in] argv
\parblock
An array of UTF-8 encoded, null terminated strings that specifies the program to
execute along with its arguments. Must contain at least one element. Cannot be
`NULL`.

- The first element in the array indicates the executable to run as a child
process. This can be an absolute path, a path relative to the working directory
(also passed as argument) or the name of an executable located in the PATH. It
cannot be `NULL`.
- The following elements indicate the whitespace delimited arguments passed to
the executable. None of these elements can be `NULL`.
- The final element must be `NULL`.

Example: ["cmake", "-G", "Ninja", "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release", `NULL`]
\endparblock
\param[in] argc
\parblock
Specifies the amount of elements in \p argv. Should NOT count the `NULL` value
at the end of the array. Must be bigger than or equal to 1.

Example: if argv is ["cmake", "--help", `NULL`] then \p argc is 2.
\endparblock
\param[in] working_directory Indicates the working directory for the child
process. If it is `NULL`, the child process runs in the same directory as the
parent process.

/*!
Reads up to \p size bytes from the child process' standard output and stores
them in \p buffer. \p bytes_read is used to store the amount of bytes read from
\p stream.

Assuming no other errors occur this function will return #REPROC_SUCCESS until
the child process closes the stream indicated by \p stream (the stream is closed
automatically when the child process exits) and all bytes have been read from
the given stream. This allows the function to be used in the following way to
read all data from a child process' stdout stream (the example uses C++
std::string for brevity):

\code{.cpp}
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

...

char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
std::string output{};

while (true) {
  unsigned int bytes_read = 0;
  error = reproc_read(process, REPROC_OUT, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, &bytes_read);
  if (error) { break; }

  output.append(buffer, bytes_read);
}

if (error != REPROC_STREAM_CLOSED) { return error; }

// Do something with the output
\endcode

Remember that this function reads bytes and not strings. A null terminator has
to be added to \p buffer after reading to be able to use \p buffer as a null
terminated string. This is easily accomplished as long as we make sure to leave
space for the null terminator in the buffer when reading:

\code{.c}
unsigned int bytes_read = 0;
error = reproc_read(process, REPROC_OUT, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE - 1, &bytes_read);
//                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
if (error) { return error; }

buffer[bytes_read] = '\0'; // Add null terminator
\endcode

\param[out] buffer Buffer used to store bytes read from the given stream. Cannot

Writes up to \p to_write bytes from \p buffer to the standard input (stdin) of

For pipes, the `write` system call on both Windows and POSIX platforms will
block until the requested amount of bytes have been written to the pipe so
this function should only rarely succeed without writing the full amount of
bytes requested.

(POSIX) By default, writing to a closed stdin pipe terminates the parent process
with the `SIGPIPE` signal. #reproc_write will only return #REPROC_STREAM_CLOSED
