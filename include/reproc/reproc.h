Starts the process specified by \p argv in the given working directory and
redirects its standard output streams.

If this function does not return an error the child process actually starts
executing and can be inspected using the operating system's tools for process
inspection (e.g. ps on Linux).

Every successful call to this function should be followed by a successful call
to #reproc_wait and a call to #reproc_destroy. If an error occurs during
#reproc_start all allocated resources are cleaned up before the function
returns.

\param[in,out] process Cannot be `NULL`.

\param[in] argv
\parblock
An array of UTF-8 encoded, null terminated strings specifying the program to
execute along with its arguments. Must at least contain one element. Cannot be
`NULL`.

- The first element in the array indicates the executable to run. This can be
an absolute path, a path relative to the working directory (also passed as
argument) or the name of an executable located in the PATH. Cannot be `NULL`.
- The following elements indicate the whitespace delimited arguments passed to
the executable. None of these elements can be `NULL`.
- The final element must be `NULL`.

Example: ["cmake", "-G", "Ninja", "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release", `NULL`]
\endparblock
\param[in] argc
\parblock
Specifies the amount of elements in \p argv. Should NOT include the `NULL` value
at the end of the array. Must be bigger than or equal to 1.

Example: if argv is ["cmake", "--help", `NULL`] then \p argc is 2.
\endparblock
\param[in] working_directory Indicates the working directory for the child.
process. If it is `NULL`, the child process runs in the same directory as the
current process.

For pipes, the `write` system call on both Windows and POSIX platforms will
block until the requested amount of bytes have been written to the pipe so
this function should only rarely succeed without writing the full amount of
bytes requested.

(POSIX) Writing to a closed stdin pipe by default terminates the parent

/*!
Reads up to \p size bytes from the child process' standard output and stores
them in \p buffer. \p bytes_read is used to store the amount of bytes read.

Assuming no other errors occur this function returns #REPROC_SUCCESS until the
child process closes its standard output stream (happens automatically when the
child process exits) and all bytes have been read from the given stream. This
allows the function to be used in the following way to read all data from a
child process stdout stream (uses C++ std::string for brevity):

\code{.cpp}
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

...

char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
std::string output{};

while (true) {
  unsigned int bytes_read = 0;
  error = reproc_read(process, REPROC_OUT, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, &bytes_read);
  if (error) { break; }

  output.append(buffer, bytes_read);
}

if (error != REPROC_STREAM_CLOSED) { return error; }

// Do something with output
\endcode

Remember that this function reads bytes and not strings. It is up to the user
to add a null terminator if he wants to use \p buffer as a null terminated
string after this function completes. However, this is easily accomplished as
long as we make sure to leave space for the null terminator in the buffer when
reading:

\code{.c}
unsigned int bytes_read = 0;
error = reproc_read(process, REPROC_OUT, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE - 1, &bytes_read);
//                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
if (error) { return error; }

buffer[bytes_read] = '\0'; // Add null terminator
\endcode

\param[in,out] process Cannot be `NULL`.
\param[in] stream Stream to read from. Cannot be #REPROC_IN.
\param[out] buffer Buffer used to store bytes read from the given stream.
