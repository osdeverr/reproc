  // On POSIX systems, by default file descriptors are inherited by child
  // processes when calling `exec`. To prevent unintended leaking of file
  // descriptors to child processes, POSIX provides a function `fcntl` which can
  // be used to set the `FD_CLOEXEC` flag which closes a file descriptor when
  // `exec` (or one of its variants) is called. However, using `fcntl`
  // introduces a race condition since any process spawned in another thread
  // after a file descriptor is created (for example using `pipe`) but before
  // `fcntl` is called to set `FD_CLOEXEC` on the file descriptor will still
  // inherit that file descriptor.

  // To get around this race condition we use the `pipe2` function when it
  // is available which takes the `O_CLOEXEC` flag as an argument. This ensures
  // the file descriptors of the created pipe are closed when `exec` is called.
  // If `pipe2` is not available we fall back to calling `fcntl` to set
  // `FD_CLOEXEC` immediately after creating a pipe.
