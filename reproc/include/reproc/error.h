/*!
Returns the last system error code.

On Windows this function returns the result of `GetLastError`. On POSIX systems
this function returns the value of `errno`. The value is not saved so other
functions that modify the results of `GetLastError` or `errno` should not be
called if you want to retrieve the last system error that occurred in one of
reproc's API functions.

On POSIX systems, if an error occurs after `fork` but before `exec` it is
communicated to the parent process which sets its own `errno` value to the
`errno` value of the child process. This makes it possible to retrieve errors
that happen after forking with this function (for example in `chdir` or `exec`).
