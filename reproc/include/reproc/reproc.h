/*!
Starts the process specified by `argv` in the given working directory and
redirects its input, output and error streams.

If this function does not return an error the child process will have started
running and can be inspected using the operating system's tools for process
inspection (e.g. ps on Linux).

Every successful call to this function should be followed by a successful call
to `reproc_wait` or `reproc_stop` and a call to `reproc_destroy`. If an error
occurs during `reproc_start` all allocated resources are cleaned up before
`reproc_start` returns and no further action is required.

`argv` is an array of UTF-8 encoded, null terminated strings that specifies the
program to execute along with its arguments. It has the following layout:

- The first element indicates the executable to run as a child process. This can
be an absolute path, a path relative to the working directory of the parent
process or the name of an executable located in the PATH. It cannot be `NULL`.
- The following elements indicate the whitespace delimited arguments passed to
the executable. None of these elements can be `NULL`.
- The final element must be `NULL`.

Example: ["cmake", "-G", "Ninja", "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release", `NULL`]

`argc` specifies the amount of elements in `argv`. It must NOT count the `NULL`
value at the end of the array.

Example: if `argv` is `["cmake", "--help", NULL]` then `argc` is 2.

`working_directory` specifies the working directory for the child process. If it
is `NULL`, the child process runs in the same directory as the parent process.

Possible errors:
- `REPROC_PIPE_LIMIT_REACHED`
- `REPROC_PROCESS_LIMIT_REACHED`
- `REPROC_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY`
- `REPROC_INVALID_UNICODE`
- `REPROC_PERMISSION_DENIED`

/*!
Reads up to `size` bytes from the child process stream indicated by `stream`
(cannot be `REPROC_IN`) and stores them them in `buffer`. The amount of bytes
read is stored in `bytes_read`.

Possible errors:
- `REPROC_STREAM_CLOSED`
- `REPROC_INTERRUPTED`

Assuming no other errors occur this function will return `REPROC_SUCCESS` until
the stream is closed and all remaining data has been read. This allows the
function to be used as follows to read all data from a child process' stdout
stream (`std::string` is used for brevity):

```c++
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

...

char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
std::string output{};

while (true) {
  unsigned int bytes_read = 0;
  error = reproc_read(process, REPROC_OUT, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, &bytes_read);
  if (error) { break; }

  output.append(buffer, bytes_read);
}

if (error != REPROC_STREAM_CLOSED) { return error; }

// Do something with the output
```

Remember that this function reads bytes and not strings. To use `buffer` as a
null terminated string, A null terminator has to be added after reading. This is
easily accomplished as long as we make sure to leave space for a null terminator
when reading:

```c++
unsigned int bytes_read = 0;
error = reproc_read(process, REPROC_OUT, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE - 1, &bytes_read);
//                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
if (error) { return error; }

buffer[bytes_read] = '\0'; // Add null terminator
```

with the `SIGPIPE` signal. `reproc_write` will only return

/*!
Simplifies calling combinations of `reproc_wait`, `reproc_terminate` and

`reproc_wait`) until the corresponding timeout expires before continuing with
the next step.

This function should not be called after one of `reproc_wait` or `reproc_stop`
has returned `REPROC_SUCCESS` for that child process.

Example:

Wait 10 seconds for the child process to exit on its own before sending
`SIGTERM` (POSIX) or `CTRL-BREAK` (Windows) and waiting five more seconds for
the child process to exit.

```c
REPROC_ERROR error = reproc_stop(process,
                                 REPROC_WAIT, 10000,
                                 REPROC_TERMINATE, 5000,
                                 REPROC_NOOP, 0);
```

Call `reproc_wait`, `reproc_terminate` and `reproc_kill` directly if you need
extra logic such as logging between calls.

(`c1`,`t1`), (`c2`,`t2`) and (`c3`,`t3`) are pairs that instruct `reproc_stop`
how to stop a process. The first element of each pair instructs `reproc_stop` to
execute the corresponding function to stop the process. The second element of
each pair tells `reproc_stop` how long to wait after executing the function
indicated by the first element.

If `exit_status` is not `NULL`, it is used to store the exit status of the child
process.

See `reproc_wait` for the list of possible errors.
