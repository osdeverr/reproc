/*!
Starts the process specified by `argv` in the given working directory and
redirects its input, output and error streams.

If this function does not return an error the child process will have started
running and can be inspected using the operating system's tools for process
inspection (e.g. ps on Linux).

Every successful call to this function should be followed by a successful call
to `reproc_wait` or `reproc_stop` and a call to `reproc_destroy`. If an error
occurs during `reproc_start` all allocated resources are cleaned up before
`reproc_start` returns and no further action is required.

`argv` is an array of UTF-8 encoded, null terminated strings that specifies the
program to execute along with its arguments. It has the following layout:

- The first element indicates the executable to run as a child process. This can
be an absolute path, a path relative to the working directory of the parent
process or the name of an executable located in the PATH. It cannot be `NULL`.
- The following elements indicate the whitespace delimited arguments passed to
the executable. None of these elements can be `NULL`.
- The final element must be `NULL`.

Example: ["cmake", "-G", "Ninja", "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release", `NULL`]

`environment` is an array of UTF-8 encoded, null terminated strings that
specifies the environment for the child process. It has the following layout:

- All elements except the final element must be of the format `NAME=VALUE`.
- The final element must be `NULL`.

Example: ["IP=127.0.0.1", "PORT=8080", `NULL`]

If `environment` is `NULL`, the child process inherits the environment of the
current process.

`working_directory` specifies the working directory for the child process. If it
is `NULL`, the child process runs in the working directory of the parent
process.

Possible errors:
- `REPROC_ERROR_SYSTEM`

/*!
Simplifies calling combinations of `reproc_wait`, `reproc_terminate` and
`reproc_kill`. The function executes each specified step and waits (using
`reproc_wait`) until the corresponding timeout expires before continuing with
the next step.

Example:

Wait 10 seconds for the child process to exit on its own before sending
`SIGTERM` (POSIX) or `CTRL-BREAK` (Windows) and waiting five more seconds for
the child process to exit.

```c
REPROC_ERROR error = reproc_stop(process,
                                 REPROC_WAIT, 10000,
                                 REPROC_TERMINATE, 5000,
                                 REPROC_NOOP, 0);
```

Call `reproc_wait`, `reproc_terminate` and `reproc_kill` directly if you need
extra logic such as logging between calls.

(`c1`,`t1`), (`c2`,`t2`) and (`c3`,`t3`) are pairs that instruct `reproc_stop`
how to stop a process. The first element of each pair instructs `reproc_stop` to
execute the corresponding function to stop the process. The second element of
each pair tells `reproc_stop` how long to wait after executing the function
indicated by the first element.

If this function returns `REPROC_SUCCESS`, `process` has exited and its exit
status can be retrieved with `reproc_exit_status`.
